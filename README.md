# Genetic Algorithms with pyevolve

<img src="logo.png" align="center">

[Pyevolve](http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/0_6rc1/) was developed to be a complete genetic algorithm framework written in pure python. The main objectives were:

* **written in pure python**, to maximize the cross-platform issue;
* **easy to use** API;
* **see the evolution**, the user can and must see and interact with the evolution statistics, graphs, etc;
* **extensible**, the user can create new representations, genetic operators like crossover, mutation, etc;
* **fast**, the design must be optimized for performance;
* **common features**, the framework must implement the most common features: selectors like roulette wheel, tournament, ranking, uniform; scaling schemes like linear scaling, etc;
* **default parameters**, we must have default operators, settings, etc in all options;
* **open-source**, the source is for everyone, not for only one.

## Aim of these notebooks

You will learn the basic functioning of Pyevolve. You will make scripts for using genetic algorithms in simple problems.

* [First Example](https://github.com/RobInLabUJI/GeneticAlgorithm/blob/main/First_Example.ipynb)
* [Graphical Analysis](Graphical%20Analysis.ipynb)
* [Rastrigin Function](Rastrigin.ipynb)
* [Travelling Salesman Problem](TSP.ipynb)
